                    <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                        instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to
                        the

                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
                        iOS applications using React
                        and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                        components: <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code</em>. You can learn more about React in the
                        next
                        section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                    <p class="pb-28">React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library
                        for building user interfaces
                        with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                    <p class="pb-30">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p class="pb-30"><strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to
                        React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to
                        work in.</p>
                    <p><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
                        inside JavaScript
                        like so: <span class="color-point">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your
                            cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.</p>
                    <p>The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because
                        JSX is
                        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                            class="color-point">name</span> for the cat, name,
                        and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="color-point">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-28"><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    <p><strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments
                        you use to configure how
                        components render,
                        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                        changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                    <h2 class="h2">handling text input <sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                    <p class="pb-30">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                        <em>onChangeText</em>
                        prop
                        that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
